Description: Assorted tools for genetic and pharmacogenetic association 
	analyses.  The current focus is on tools that operate in an
	environment where genetic data and summary statistics are
	available via SQL queries against a database.
	There are also functions for simplifying and standardising
	pharmacogenetic analysis and reporting.  There are (legacy)
	functions to support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP
	conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses,
	using summary statistics instead of using subject-specific
	data.  There are (legacy) helper functions for reading and
	manipulating subject-specific genotype data, which provide a
	platform for calculating the summary statistics, or for using
	R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific GWAS
	analysis tools.
